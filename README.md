# Breeden-Litzenberger on SP500 Options

This project is a simple implementation of the **Breeden-Litzenberger** approach to extract the **risk-neutral probability density function (PDF)** from real-world SP500 option data.

I use data from **Yahoo Finance**, specifically from:
- ðŸ“… **08/04/2025**
- ðŸ“… **09/04/2025**

Both datasets refer to **European-style call options** expiring on **01/05/2025**.

## Objective

The goal is to visualize how the **risk-neutral distribution** evolves in response to market eventsâ€”in this case, **Trumpâ€™s decision to pause tariffs**. By comparing two consecutive days of option prices, we can observe how market expectations shifted.
